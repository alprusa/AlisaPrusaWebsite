			<p>The web is a large place where there are new sites and pages to be discovered just one more click away. Though the web may not have been setup as a
			labyrinth it certainly has become one over the years since its birth. Our small labyrinth illustrates how a link can take you in many directions through
			the internet with a new link made every second. A “Java applet... that is programmed, over the course of many trillions of years, to run through every
			possible image that can be formed within a 32 x 32 grid” (Tribe, 9). Tribe and Reena presented the logo applet in a way that demonstrates that there are
			many different possible ways to illuminate the pixels on a screen for a logo. However, the patterns overall have little individuality as
			each pattern has only one pixel difference from the last. There is or will be a reproduction of every page on the internet and the differences will be so
			slight it is hard to know which one was the first. “The traces of the first can be revealed only by chemical or physical analysis which it is impossible
			to perform on a reproduction; changes of ownership to a tradition which must be traced from the situation of the original.” (Benjamin, 3) Every
			duplication deludes the original making it seem to be another reproduction. As with our labyrinth every quote is a famous quote known to many people,
			they are quotes that people repeat and often will say incorrectly. Our labyrinth represents how the original can change, to a degree, just by
			associating a quote with someone else. As with our labyrinth we turned the inspirational quotes to be a bit more humorous in nature just because of there
			change in authorship. So this is why reproduction happens and they can be different but not so drastically that it makes the pages something entirely new.</p>

			<p class="entry-title">Project #2: Mapping</p>
			<p class="date">Posted: October 11th, 2015</p>
		
			<p>The map below was created in a similar fashion to how Mark Lombardi made his works. “My purpose throughout is to interpret the material by
			juxtaposing and assembling the notations into a unified, coherent whole. In some cases I use a set of stacked, parallel lines to establish
			a time frame” (Lucarelli). Lombardi's approach seemed to be the best way to create my map because the labyrinth that the map represents is
			already connected in a similar way to how Lombardi's mappings were. In retrospect, in a group of five we created a labyrinth, a set of HTML
			pages that were designed to connect through hyperlinks. The cartography represents each possible path through the labyrinth. The colors
			of the connecting lines represent the colors used on each page. The connector color chosen indicates a direction, an invisible arrow, as
			the color comes from the page which is the start point of that arrow. The single blue circle in the map represents the start of the
			labyrinth, also the blue color was meant to indicate that the circle is a hyperlink. Each circle is meant to represent a city, or page, on
			this map as they relate to one another and reside in the same country, or project, but they are still their own cities that have their own
			style and traditions. They are connected through their roads and the rulings, or layout, that each follow. The little blue circle was
			meant so that none of the roads intersected in an awkward way. The circle represents the connection between each page of the labyrinth and
			how they cannot cross each other or change directions at this meeting point just stop and say hello. This map illustrates how the pages
			work together, share similar traits, and that they can stand alone without the others. Therefore, just as Lombardi creates his integrate
			maps in ways that connect each aspect of his ideals, my simpler map demonstrates that same connection between every idea relating to the
			labyrinth.</p>

			<p class="entry-title">Project #3: Processing</p>
			<p class="date">Posted: October 18, 2015</p>
		
			<p>Edgar Allen Poe: <a href="http://people.ucsc.edu/~aprusa/film170A/p5-release/project3/">Processing Applet</a><p>
			<p>To begin with the idea for the Edgar Allen Poe Processing Applet started out simple with just the idea of mixing images with the poems text.
			As I sat down and thought more about what to do with this concept I figured I could replace some of the text with the images so that then the
			poem would still exist with the same meaning but instead be told through images. To allow the poem to be seen I made the images interactive
			and so you can click on the images to make the original text poem appear. As this made the poem interesting the idea did not incorporate the
			idea of Brion Gysin and his cut-up method of creating poems, which I wanted to incorporate into the project. As William S. Burroughs explains
			how Gysin's method works “Take a page... Now cut down the middle and cross the middle. You have four sections: 1 2 3 4 . . . one two three
			four. Now rearrange the sections placing section four with section one and section two with section three” (Burroughs). So I wanted to use
			Gysin's cut-up method because I thought it would add more to the page and it would go well with the mystery of the poem itself. The reason for
			the second poem was just so that I would not ruin my design scheme with a standard restart button so I added that poem and clicking on the blue
			text “Restart?” sets back the images and the original order of the poem. Because of my design scheme a dark poem seemed to be the best fit to
			help tell the story of what was happening on the applet. Essentially, my Processing Applet is  a digital representation of Brion Gysin's
			cut-up method as the applet changes the layout of the poems text and the sorting hat adds the more historic aspect of how he decided the order
			of his cut-up poems.</p>

			<p>Flip books might seem simple at first glance but the details that flip books can convey can be very complex. With the flip book shown in
			the video below it first as a short animation I made with Blender, a 3D modeling program. The animation was reduced to 25 frames. This
			reduction caused some lose in the movement of the animation but these 25 frames still illustrate the same animation. The animation is shown
			in a linear progression as the frames come one by one. In Understanding Comics Scott McCloud talks about how there is an essence of time and
			space happening between each panel of a comic. Though a flip book may be a bit more like a film than a comic but the feeling of time is
			still present. The reduction in the frames, as mentioned before, caused a few gaps in the movement of the characters and so the viewers must
			fill these gaps mentally. Even though some of the frames may no longer actually exist the imagined frames are essentially the same
			presenting the same linear progression. So animations and comics are told linearly as mentioned by McCloud, “Comics readers are also
			conditioned by other media and the "Real Time" of everyday life to expect a very linear progression. Just a straight line from point A to
			point B” (106). Just as the story in the flip book even if you start from the bottom of the book instead of the top the frames still move
			forward in one linear moment. Why this is important is because even though I originally made my flip book on the computer as a standard
			computer animation converting this to a simple flip book did not result in the lose of the linear motion or the story that is being conveyed. 
			hus the only difference is that as the viewer you are doing the computer's job by cycling through the frames to see the movement of the
			characters in the flip book and showing every frame that makes up that movement..</p>

			<p>“A glitch occurs on the occasion where there is an absence of (expected) functionality, whether understood in a technical or
            social sense“ (Menkman, 10). As explained by Rosa Menkman glitch art is a new way to express artistic concepts. Throughout my work
            there are various glitches and bugs. With the start of my piece everything seems to be a bit off putting because of the man. As
            soon as the canvas is clicked then that off putting feeling is enhanced. Each time the applet is revisited the switch between the
            two canvas images (the glitch) is different sometimes it becomes almost absent and others it becomes very twitchy. The initial
            look of the piece was based on a movie I recently watched called The Babadook. A movie about a dark figure that kidnaps children.
            And this has an eerie relation to the next canvas image look but it is only clear once you enter the game. At first the hotdog
            when it appears maybe humors as most people do not eat their hotdogs with a utensil. However, the thoughts about what the hotdog
            means changes once you enter the game, Cannibowl City. To give the idea that maybe this hotdog is not made from cows. The glitch
            that happens (side note, hidden glitches can be found throughout Cannibowl City) is meant to add to the questioning of what is it
            that I am really looking at and why is everything going so wrong. By using what a glitch does to the mind, as in how it makes
            people experience something unexpected, adds to the fact of playing the game where you must do something you would never consider
            doing, which is cannibalism. Thus, the use of the glitch is to add to the eerie and unsettling aspect of the story my piece is
            trying to convey.</p>

			<p class="entry-title">Project #7: SoundWalk</p>
			<p class="date">Posted: November 11th, 2015</p>
		
			<p>Something that seems to be consistent with the Ultra-red assignments is that most students did not want to participate or lead.
			At the Ultra-red talk Learning Exodus: Education, Value, and Resistance one speaker posed questions and often there would be
			silent pauses until someone decided to speak or the Ultra-red speaker would change to a new subject. Some probably didn't know how
			to answer, and others didn't care to respond. Each person had their own reasons for not participating but the main point is that
			with all the people there little conversation happened. Additionally, while making the original recording for the sound walk there
			also was little interest for the group to lead or participate. As suggested by the audio clip the group stood waiting to see who
			would lead first. This silence happened again each time a new leader needed to walk, each wait shorter then the first. Hence, it
			seemed apparent that no one really wanted to participate or lead. In the Five Protocols for Organized Listening other students
			were asked to participate however some certainly had no interest, "Moving around the room if I found a group had become stuck or
			arrived at a proposal through little effort I turned their ideas into questions. In other instances a particularly dominant
			individual forced the group to follow his or her lead" (24). The lack of participation seemed to be mostly the act of students
            especially the younger students. In any case when students are asked to participate in something they have no interest in they
            will put little effort into the work. This is not to say that students do not care about anything just that they will decide when,
            if at all, they will participate or lead.</p>
