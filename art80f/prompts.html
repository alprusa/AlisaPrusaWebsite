		<p> The painting in my picture is a self-portrait and so I represent myself as part of the Age of Mechanical Reproduction.</p>
		
		<p>The image I created is meant to show the reproducibility of any art form, and how the aura from the original art changes.
			Paintings tend to convey a strong aura, or the feelings a viewer gets from an art,  then other art forms. Art is
			used to insight various depths of understanding and with hand crafted arts this is both easier to convey and observe,
			for the artist is part of the work. For a photograph there is a more limited depth and so photos can cause a disconnect
			from the aura. Even if the photograph is of a painting the photograph looses the artist as the finer details of the
			painting are now gone. So when the form of art changes the original aura becomes something entirely new and that is
			often not a good or desired change.  As Walter Benjamin stated, "What they intended and achieved was a relentless
			destruction of the aura of their creations, which they branded as reproductions with the very means of production."
			(Benjamin, 12). So as an art is constantly copied this devalues the first and destroys the aura in the original.
			Consider the mug with the same image of the painting it is clear that the aura has changed drastically and with the
			additions to the image as well the observer gets basically the opposite effect of the original aura. Consider that
			initially the aura might have been meant to provoke some kind of sadness toward the women in the painting, however, the
			mug turns the image into humorous joke making the aura that of joy not sadness. Therefore, with each reproduction,
			varied or not, of art changes the aura in a way that often is not what the artist intended.</p>

		<p> Seeing is believing and that may or may not be true when it comes to content and people on social media sites. Social media
        sites embrace different cultures which develop around what the site offers and advertises to their users. As paraphrased
        by Jessie Daniels “Watkins observes that ‘the young people surveyed and spoke with are attracted to online communities that
        connect them to people who are like them in some notable way,’ most notably race (97)” (8). As Daniels and Watkins explain
        social media sites are a place for people to find people like themselves so they can express themselves as they are and not how
        society makes them act offline. As the image below indicates there are many different social media sites that provide ways to
        express yourself and each have their own communities. Facebook 's community is built around offline friends, Twitter is more
        built for online communities, LinkIn is for professionals in the workplace, while Pinterest is more for artistic people. As the image
        illustrates these communities exist both together, hidden emoji, and individually, text in the background. They work together
        as people using them find their communities that exists on each site. However, individually because some communities find no
        connection with certain sites they tend to stay on certain sites more than others. An example of this is with new artists Pinterest
        users may intimidate new users confidence and so they may post on Facebook or Twitter instead to avoid undesired criticisms.
        Though this is not actually enforced by the sites themselves the communities built around a site can cause people to feel
        unwelcome if they do not belong to the community. As mentioned previously by Daniels and Watkins these communities
        generally evolve around race or ethnicity, for example Facebook is seen as a site for 'white' internet users and Twitter for 'black'.
        Therefore, people come to these sites to find communities who share their race or interests so they can be free to express
        themselves with a lot less repressions than offline presents.</p>

		<p>Mobile devices have allowed many people throughout the world to have access to the internet. Smart phones give people access to
        the internet who did not have the net before. This allows people the ability to learn many things about their government and
        society that they may not have been able to know before. The knowledge that the internet provides helps people see problems with
        the world and allows them the chance to form social movements and try to make change to flaws in the world. As Laila Shereen
        stated "convergence of (1) a technology infrastructure consisting of the Internet, micro-blogging, Twitter, Facebook, smart
        phones,...; (2) physical habits such as communication habits,...; and (3) a national narrative of al-thawra that enabled the
        mobilization of the body politic" (248) all available forms of communication both digital and physical helps grow various social
        movements. For many movements they start in the physical world due mainly to some social issues. Now a days they can grow and gain
        power and strength through social media sites on the internet which lets them be able to find people who believe in these social
        movements. Utilizing these social media sites has helped cause uprisings like that in Egypt in 2011 to reach international
        attention making the movement grow larger then it would have been just being contained inside of Egypt. Therefore, as found in the
        applet below, there are many different social media platforms that people have used to communicate with people throughout the
        world. Smart phones having given many people internet access has given knowledge and power to help inspire and grow social
        movements into becoming a force that can't just be ignored.</p>

		<p>Something that seems to be consistent with the Ultra-red assignments is that most students did not want to participate or lead.
		At the Ultra-red talk Learning Exodus: Education, Value, and Resistance one speaker posed questions and often there would be
		silent pauses until someone decided to speak or the Ultra-red speaker would change to a new subject. Some probably didn't know how
		to answer, and others didn't care to respond. Each person had their own reasons for not participating but the main point is that
		with all the people there little conversation happened. Additionally, while making the original recording for the sound walk there
		also was little interest for the group to lead or participate. As suggested by the audio clip the group stood waiting to see who
		would lead first. This silence happened again each time a new leader needed to walk, each wait shorter then the first. Hence, it
		seemed apparent that no one really wanted to participate or lead. In the Five Protocols for Organized Listening other students
		were asked to participate however some certainly had no interest, "Moving around the room if I found a group had become stuck or
		arrived at a proposal through little effort I turned their ideas into questions. In other instances a particularly dominant
		individual forced the group to follow his or her lead" (24). The lack of participation in these cases seem non biased to race,
		ethnicity, or geography it's about the individuals interests and motivations. In any case when students are asked to participate
		in something they have no interest in they will put little effort into the work. This is not to say that students do nt care about
		anything just that they will decide when, if at all, they will participate or lead.</p>

		<p>So many people today, even in less developed countries, use phones especially smart phones because of their portability and their affordability (in comparison to a
        computer). In California we see people with phones all the time taking them out to pass the time by playing games chatting with friends or just surfing the web. At
        Santa Cruz whenever I wait at a bus stop I always see someone on their phone as they wait for a bus. In the past people use to only go online when they were at home
        because big tower computers are not very portable. And when people did go on their computers they would tend to only use them for games or occasional school work. Now
        everyone is on their phones doing anything from games to checking their emails to chatting with friends. As Paul Mason stated in his article “For social media has moved
        the 'collective mental arena', with it's intense interpersonal bonds, from the realm of gaming and fantasy into the world of everyday interaction” (134). Mason also
        goes on to explain how the use of the internet especially on smart phones is greatly increased over the years. As an understanding we as humans today rely very heavily
        on the internet for everything we do because of how simple and quick it makes everyday tasks be. With this we have accepted the internet as part of our existence and
        so when you see people standing around using their phones generally we now just pass that off as normal. With everyone using their phones we have brought the digital
        world into the real world in the sense that so many people are constantly connected to the internet. Thus, as a society we have made the interactions of the internet
        part of our normal everyday lives.</p>
